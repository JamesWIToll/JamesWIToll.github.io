      "description" : "A local coop game answering the question: What if Rocket League was a 2D game with penguins instead of cars? Collaborated with members of the Triangle Interactive Arts Council to develop Bubble League for the Global Game Jam 2025. Worked on much of the core physics and player controls. In just a few days, we developed a solid fun little game.",

      "description" : "A simple 3D rendering engine that documents my early progress learning the OpenGL 4.6 API. It includes 3D rendering of primitives such as cubes and spheres with textures, simple phong lighting, programmatic UV- and Ico-sphere vertex and texture coordinate generation, and a look-around camera.",

Right now I am working purely on the 3D asset import to rendering pipeline. I have plans to create an editor and possibly integrate a game logic scripting system much later on. ",
